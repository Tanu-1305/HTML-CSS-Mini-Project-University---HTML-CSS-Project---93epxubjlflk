Project title: COOK & TASTE
Description: Created Recipe website with various pages like: Home, 404 error, About, Contact, Recipes, Single Recipe (detailed recipe with preparation and cooking procedure), tags etc.
I have added Indian food recipes with preparation time and cooking time included with it. I have also divided the recipes as per 3 time meals like: Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Also added header and footer to it. Header includes the Title and tagline. Footer includes year, brand and my name.
